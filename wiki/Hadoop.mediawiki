== MapReduce v2 (YARN) ==

MapReduce has undergone a complete overhaul and CDH4 now includes MapReduce 2.0 (MRv2). The fundamental idea of MRv2's YARN architecture is to split up the two primary responsibilities of the JobTracker — resource management and job scheduling/monitoring — into separate daemons: a global ResourceManager (RM) and per-application ApplicationMasters (AM). With MRv2, the ResourceManager (RM) and per-node NodeManagers (NM), form the data-computation framework. The ResourceManager service effectively replaces the functions of the JobTracker, and NodeManagers run on slave nodes instead of TaskTracker daemons. The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific library and is tasked with negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the tasks.
