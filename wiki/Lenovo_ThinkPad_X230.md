### Hardware

Below is the short list for this setup. *After-market SSDs were bought*
because Lenovo is charging a lot for these.

#### Compatibility

##### Fingerprint reader

Everything works out-of-the-box except the integrated fingerprint
scanner. To enable it you need to install some extra packages:

Just make sure you press ESC and login with your password when you boot
the computer if you want your login keyring to be unlocked.

##### Bluetooth

Problem: A number of Bluetooth profiles won't work until the firmware is
loaded.

Download this ![](Fw-0a5c_21e6.hcd "fig:Fw-0a5c_21e6.hcd") and put it at
(all lowercase)

### System Configuration

#### Kernel

The following enables the new P-state Intel CPU scheduler and some power
saving options.

#### TrackPoint

You can change the default speed and sensitivity of the TrackPoint.

#### PulseAudio

Automatically switch to Bluetooth or USB headset by adding the
following:

#### SSD

'''If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you can skip these steps since it
already runs periodically. '''

If you are using an SSD enable TRIM to always get the best performance.
Just add to the mount options. The option avoids some writes on the SSD
which is also desirable.

If you use LVM you have to also change a line in the LVM configuration
file.

#### Intel Rapid Start Technology

The Intel chipset supports Intel Rapid Start, a technology that allows
the laptop to go into a deeper sleep ACPI S4 (hibernate) from ACPI S3
(standby) after some period of time.

This type of hibernation is directly supported in the hardware, so you
will not see any traditional OS boot sequences during wake up from a
hibernated machine as before.

To setup Intel Rapid Start you need:

`* an SSD`  
`* a BIOS that supports Intel Rapid Start Technology`  
`* a partition (primary/logical) >= than the laptop's physical memory`

Then you must give the partition a specific id as to be recognized by
the hardware. According to Intel, it must be:

`* in fdisk, id: 84, or`  
`* in gdisk, guid: D3BFE2DE-3DAF-11DF-BA40-E3A556D89593`

#### Zram/Compcache

If you are low on memory you can always compress your data in RAM.

Just issue and check if it works with
