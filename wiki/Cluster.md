We are very fortunate to have a powerful computing cluster to aid in
research and development. Currently this cluster is composed by 4
identical rack-mounted (4u) computing nodes with GPGPU capability and an
additional tower computer that serves as the master node. The latter is
used for issuing jobs or tasks, to be processed in the cluster, and for
management, coordination and distribution of said jobs or tasks. It is
also used occasionally to host internet-facing demos of our work.

Machines
--------

Our machines are named after characters in Science-Fiction works. Flavio
Martins unilaterally decided to start with the characters from the
Christopher Nolan movie "Inception".
