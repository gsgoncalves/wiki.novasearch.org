IN PROGRESS: Some guidelines/tutorials for software installation in the
Rocks Cluster.

Python Stuff
------------

### General Advice

Compute nodes have a set of useful libraries installed like numpy,
scipy, pandas, etc... The pip tool, which allows one to easily install
new libraries and is also available. It may be used to install any
python library from the Python Package Index or from a git repository.
Example of a command to install a package/library:

`pip install `<package_name>

Since we are simple peasants on the cluster and we don't have sudo (it
makes a lot of sense :)) we need to install libraries locally. To
achieve this, one option is to add the option `--user` to the pip
install command:

`pip install `<package_name>` --user`

For more info see:
[1](http://pip-python3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user_guide.html#user-installs)

To upgrade a library we specify the argument `--upgrade`, like this:

`pip install --upgrade `<package_name>` --user`

### Machine Learning Packages

#### Scipy

The Scipy package[2](https://www.scipy.org/) provides a collection of
mathematics, science, and engineering related libraries. It includes
packages like numpy, matplotlib,pandas, ipython, among others.

As any other package, Scipy can be installed by issuing the command:

`pip install --upgrade scipy --user`

However, it is likely that it will fail due to the fact that python
isn't able to find a BLAS library. Since our cluster Rocks, we have MKL
from Intel! To use it, we need to load it and tell pip which MKL version
we wan't numpy to use.

To load mkl on the cluster:

`module load mkl`

-   Create a configuration file for numpy named `.numpy-site.cfg` in the
    $HOME folder.
-   Copy the contents of a sample numpy config file available at
    [3](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/site.cfg.example) to
    the created file.

Change the MKL section to:
