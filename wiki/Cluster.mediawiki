We are very fortunate to have a powerful computing cluster to aid in research and development. Currently this cluster is composed by 4 identical rack-mounted (4u) computing nodes with GPGPU capability and an additional tower computer that serves as the master node. The latter is used for issuing jobs or tasks, to be processed in the cluster, and for management, coordination and distribution of said jobs or tasks. It is also used occasionally to host internet-facing demos of our work.

Our nodes are named after characters in Science-Fiction works. Flavio Martins unilaterally decided to start with the characters from the Christopher Nolan movie "Inception".

== Network ==

To access the cluster you need to log on to the SSH server on ariadne.imtv.me (193.136.122.72).

All the nodes are interconnected using a high-performance Gigabit switch.

== Security ==

The cluster has Single Sign-On configured using a combination of LDAP and Kerberos. User account and groups management is handled by LDAP on the master node.

Kerberos allows users who authenticate with the master node to obtain tickets to access other all the other nodes with SSH.

Users homes are also mounted on all the computing nodes with NFS allowing you to have access to your files on any node. Do however take in mind that if you're doing any intensive IO work it is always better to use a local folder on the computing node. Usually the norm is to use the root directory /tmp however all the files in this directory are removed upon reboot, so consider creating a new folder with your username inside the root directory /localstore and use that instead if you want your data to persist.
