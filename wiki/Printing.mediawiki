== HOWTO: MF411dw ==

First, take a leap of faith and download the driver at:
http://files.canon-europe.com/files/soft45505/Driver/CQue_v4.0.0_Linux_64_EN.deb

We need to create the following link so the filter can be found on the path!

    $ sudo ln -s /opt/cel/bin/sicgsfilter /bin/sicgsfilter

Without this all your printing jobs will fail due to "Filter Failed" like shown below:

    D [08/Jun/2018:14:50:40 +0100] [Job 95] /bin/sh: 1: sicgsfilter: not found
    D [08/Jun/2018:14:50:40 +0100] [Job 95] renderer exited with status 127
    D [08/Jun/2018:14:50:40 +0100] [Job 95] Process is dying with \"Encountered error Broken pipe during fwrite\", exit stat 1
    D [08/Jun/2018:14:50:40 +0100] [Job 95] Cleaning up...
    D [08/Jun/2018:14:50:40 +0100] [Job 95] Killing pdf-to-ps

We will need the full address of a printer.
For convenience here is the address of one:
