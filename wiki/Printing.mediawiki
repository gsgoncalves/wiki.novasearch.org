== How to use the new Canon MF411dw/416dw PS ==

We will need the full address of a printer.
For convenience here is the address of one:

    ipp://print.ci.fct.unl.pt:631/printers/di-canon-MF411DW-piso3

First download the driver at:
http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/8/0100007658/05/linux-UFRII-drv-v350-uken.tar.gz

Extract the archive and install the 64-bit packages:

    $ cd linux-UFRII-drv-v350-uken/64-bit_Driver/Debian
    $ sudo dpkg -i cndrvcups-ufr2-uk_3.50-1_amd64.deb cndrvcups-common_3.90-1_amd64.deb cndrvcups-utility_1.10-1_amd64.deb

Take a leap of faith and download another driver at:
http://files.canon-europe.com/files/soft45505/Software/CQue_v3.0.5_Linux_64_EN.deb

We need to create the following link so the filter can be found on the path!

    $ sudo ln -s /opt/cel/bin/sicgsfilter /bin/sicgsfilter

Without this all your printing jobs will fail due to "Filter Failed" like shown below:
