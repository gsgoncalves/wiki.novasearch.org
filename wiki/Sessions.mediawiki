== X2Go Remote access ==

This a remote desktop solution akin to FreeNX. It is really fast and useful for working directly on the cluster machines when you don't have access to a Linux machine of your own. You can reconnect and get your desktop session  back (e.g.: windows and apps from last session).

Please take in mind that a desktop session takes up significant resources so use this feature wisely and log out your session when you don't need it anymore.


== Terminal sessions ==

You can use the screen and tmux terminal multiplexing software to persist your console sessions on the nodes.

We recommend the use of byobu (tmux wrapper) that is already installed on the nodes.
